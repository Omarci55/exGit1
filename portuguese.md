## Portuguese Language

Portuguese (português or, in full, língua portuguesa) is a Romance language of the Indo-European language family, originating in the Iberian Peninsula of Europe. It is the sole official language of Portugal, Angola, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde, São Tomé and Príncipe, and Brazil,[6] while having co-official language status in East Timor, Equatorial Guinea, and Macau. A Portuguese-speaking person or nation is referred to as "Lusophone" (lusófono). As the result of expansion during colonial times, a cultural presence of Portuguese and Portuguese creole speakers is also found around the world.[7] Portuguese is part of the Ibero-Romance group that evolved from several dialects of Vulgar Latin in the medieval Kingdom of Galicia and the County of Portugal, and has kept some Celtic phonology in its lexicon.[8][9]

With approximately 250 million native speakers and 24 million L2 speakers, Portuguese has approximately 274 million total speakers. It is usually listed as the sixth-most spoken language and the third-most spoken European language in the world in terms of native speakers.[10] Being the most widely spoken language in South America[11][12] and all of the Southern Hemisphere,[13] it is also the second-most spoken language, after Spanish, in Latin America, one of the 10 most spoken languages in Africa,[14] and an official language of the European Union, Mercosur, the Organization of American States, the Economic Community of West African States, the African Union, and the Community of Portuguese Language Countries, an international organization made up of all of the world's officially Lusophone nations. In 1997, a comprehensive academic study ranked Portuguese as one of the 10 most influential languages in the world.[15][16]
